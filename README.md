The GoodRecipeToDay App is a delightful mobile application that allows users to discover, save, and share their favorite recipes. It offers a user-friendly interface and leverages a variety of technologies to deliver a seamless cooking and recipe-sharing experience.

## Features

- **Discover Recipes**: Browse through an extensive collection of mouthwatering recipes from various cuisines and categories.

- **Search and Filter**: Easily find recipes based on ingredients, cuisine types, or specific dietary preferences.

- **Favorites and Collections**: Users can save their preferred recipes to their favorites and organize them into custom collections for quick access.

- **Create and Share**: Apart from exploring existing recipes, users can contribute by adding their own recipes to the app and share them with the community.

## Technologies and Architecture

The Recipe App is built using the following technologies and architectural patterns:

- **UIKit**: The app's user interface is designed using UIKit, providing a native and intuitive experience to iOS users.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: We employ the MVVM architectural pattern to separate the app's logic from its presentation layer, promoting better maintainability and testability.

- **Firebase**: Firebase serves as the backend infrastructure, enabling real-time synchronization of recipes, user authentication, and storage of user-generated content.

- **Core Data**: The app uses Core Data to provide offline support for saving recipes and user data, allowing users to access their favorite recipes even when offline.
